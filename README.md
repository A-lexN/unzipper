# unzipper
So this is a simple js script that designed to unzip a large number of zip(and also tar) files. Using it is very simple:

1.Create a folder in which you past our script (with name like: something_name.js)

2.Write your path in archiveFolder and also extractFolder (the names speak for themselves)

3.Open the terminal and write:"npm install adm-zip"(or :"npm install tar" if it necessary)

4.Run the script: node something_name.js (also write it in the terminal)

Happines and Good luck!)
